Run 
$ make
to compile java files.

./server1.sh
./server2.sh
./server3.sh
to start three servers.

The program use java scanner to receive system input.

input "s" to start snapshot on a certain server. I use "s" instead of "snapshot" because input "s" takes less time and won't be interrupted by messages of the server.

Each snapshot is associated with a decimal number to indicate which snapshot it is. For instance, 
In server1, it may contain following message:
snapshot 0.10 (in channels + process) for process 1, 1021
snapshot 0.20 (in channels + process) for process 1, 1000
snapshot 0.30 (in channels + process) for process 1, 1001

In server2, it is 
snapshot 0.10 (in channels + process) for process 2, 999
snapshot 0.30 (in channels + process) for process 2, 1001
snapshot 0.20 (in channels + process) for process 2, 1000

In server3, it is 
snapshot 0.20 (in channels + process) for process 3, 1000
snapshot 0.10 (in channels + process) for process 3, 980
snapshot 0.30 (in channels + process) for process 3, 998

So the snapshot 0.10 on three servers are 1021, 999, 980, sum to 3000
the snapshot 0.20 on three servers are 1000, 1000, 1000, sum to 3000
the snapshot 0.30 on three servers are 1001, 1001, 998, sum to 3000

I also provides messages of separate snapshots on process and input channels for each server.
